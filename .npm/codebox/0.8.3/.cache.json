It can run on any unix-like machine (Linux, Mac OS X). It is an open source component of [codebox.io](https://www.codebox.io) (Cloud IDE as a Service).\n\nThe IDE can run on your desktop (Linux or Mac), on your server or the cloud. You can use the [codebox.io](https://www.codebox.io) service to host and manage IDE instances.\n\nCodebox is built with web technologies: `node.js`, `javascript`, `html` and `less`. The IDE possesses a very modular and extensible architecture, that allows you to build your own features with through add-ons. Codebox is the first open and modular IDE capable of running both on the Desktop and in the cloud (with offline support).\n\nThe project is open source under the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/blob/master/LICENSE) license.\nA screencast of the IDE is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvPEngyXA2A).\n\n![Image](https://raw.github.com/FriendCode/codebox/master/screenshot.png)\n\n## How to install and run Codebox\n\n#### Desktop Applications\n\nInstallers for the latest stable build for **Mac** and **Linux** can be downloaded on the [release page](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/releases).\n\nInstructions on how to install it can be found for each release.\n\n#### Install from NPM\n\nCodebox can be installed as a Node package and use programatically or from the command line.\n\nInstall Codebox globally using NPM:\n```\n$ npm install -g codebox\n```\n\nAnd start the IDE from the command line:\n```\n$ codebox run ./myworkspace --open\n```\n\nUse this command to run and open Codebox IDE. By default, Codebox uses GIT to identify you, you can use the option ```--email=john.doe@gmail.com``` to define the email you want to use during GIT operations.\n\nOthers comand line options are available and can be list with: ```codebox --help```. For deeper configuration, take a look at the documentation about [environment variables](http://help.codebox.io/ide/env.html).\n\n#### Need help?\n\nThe IDE's documentation can be found at [help.codebox.io](http://help.codebox.io).
